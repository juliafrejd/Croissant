    <p>
      Freshly-baked, deliciously flaky and buttery classic French Croissants,
      made from scratch in the comfort of your own kitchen‚Ä¶ Could there be
      anything better? With their thin crisp layers, light chewy crumb and
      complex butter notes like no other, these iconic pastries are the star of
      all French breakfasts and likely one of the most sought after treats in
      the world.
